Does this sound familiar… you’re trying to ramp up on a new project or release but some of the resources you were counting on aren’t available yet, another team or tool you depend on won’t deliver what you need or become available for another month, or maybe [third reason for delay]. However, we made an honest effort at providing our customer a delivery date, so through these delays and unexpected challenges, project management continues to report your "[RAG](https://www.leadershipthoughts.com/rag-status-definition/)" status is green - i.e. “👍”.

I think most people accept it’s unproductive to pretend setbacks or shifting priorities won’t happen; we all know they do.  Still, we’ve all been here, where there’s a gap between reality and our reporting.

At this point, it would be easy to single out our project manager, but they are, at least in part, a product of their environment too.  In most organizations, project managers are incentivized to meet their commitments- period.  I’ve discussed this world with several PMs and it’s easy to see how any deviation in the delivery date is difficult to separate from some form of personal failure on their part to "properly manage the project."  

This, frankly, is ridiculous.  

In most cases, PMs have the smallest influence over getting things completed- that’s not their role.  And yet, they live in a world where they are judged on the efficiency and accuracy of projects they can’t contribute to completing!

As delivery managers, how do we solve this?  How do we disconnect project status from individual PM’s "effectiveness", facilitate conversations at the earliest responsible moment when challenges arise, and bring visibility into our delivery process?  

How do we connect reality to our reporting?

How do we avoid this reaction when the watermelon is inevitably cut open?

To succeed here, we need to take our business partners, our Project/Program/Product Managers, and our peers on a journey.  And as the adage goes, a journey of a 1,000 miles begins under one’s feet.  So let’s muster our technical empathy, leverage the tools and advice below, and open a dialog about a partnership centered on shared goals.
