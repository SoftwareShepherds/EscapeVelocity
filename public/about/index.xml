      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re interested in helping to address a gap in our industry: communication.  Specifically, engaging internal &amp;amp; external customers in productive conversations, soliciting accurate insight into what they want, and being able to accurately, empathetically, and simply communicate back status from our technical teams.  We want to contribute to the technical community ideas, process, and tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve worked in and for organizations that feel as if they are throwing money &amp;ldquo;into a black hole&amp;rdquo; and return get back inaccurate, over budget projects.  The customers have given up their time to provide what they consider straight forward requests, have been open and response to questions, management has a schedule and a plan, and the developers are doing some of their best work delivering on features that they believe will make people happy- so &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/delivering-large-scale-it-projects-on-time-on-budget-and-on-value&#34;&gt;why do so many software projects fail&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
